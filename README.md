# VeriCred+ üéì

**Delegated, Tamper-Proof Credential Management with AI Oversight**

Built for MetaMask x Monad x Envio Hackathon

---

## üåü Overview

VeriCred+ is a next-generation credential issuance and verification system that leverages **MetaMask Smart Account Delegation**, **Monad blockchain**, and **Envio indexer** to create a seamless, fraud-resistant credential management platform.

### Problem
- Credential fraud is a multi-billion dollar problem
- Traditional verification is slow, manual, and susceptible to forgery
- Web3 onboarding is too complex for non-technical users

### Solution
A seamless dApp that allows institutions to issue credentials as Soulbound NFTs via delegated smart accounts, with AI-powered fraud analysis, all verified instantly on the Monad blockchain.

## üîë Key Technical Decisions

### Why Delegation?
- Issuers don't pay gas fees for each credential
- Backend wallet with ISSUER_ROLE executes transactions
- Tracks usage limits and expiration per delegation

### Why Monad?
- High performance EVM-compatible chain
- Low transaction costs
- Growing ecosystem

### Why Envio?
- Real-time event indexing
- GraphQL API for fast queries
- Better than polling blockchain directly

### Why MongoDB + Envio?
- MongoDB: Primary database for credentials and verifications
- Envio: Blockchain event indexing and validation
- Dual approach ensures data availability
