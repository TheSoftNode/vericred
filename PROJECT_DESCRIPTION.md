# VeriCred+ üéì

**Delegated, Tamper-Proof Credential Management with AI Oversight**

---

## üåü The Problem

Credential fraud is a **$16 billion annual crisis**:
- 60% of employers encounter fake credentials
- Traditional verification takes **weeks** and costs **$50-200 per check**
- Web3 complexity prevents mainstream adoption
- No standardized infrastructure for verifiable credentials

---

## üí° Our Solution

VeriCred+ combines **AI-powered fraud detection**, **MetaMask Smart Account Delegation**, and **Monad blockchain** to create instant, trustless credential verification. By leveraging **Envio's real-time indexing**, we transform credential management into a seamless, consumer-friendly experience.

---

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### Credential Issuance Flow

![Issuer Dashboard](docs/Images/Issuer-dashboard.png)

1. **Issuer enters credential details** - Recipient address, credential type, and metadata
2. **AI Agent analyzes fraud risk** - Queries Envio for recipient's on-chain history
3. **GPT-4o generates risk score** - Low/Medium/High risk assessment with recommendations
4. **Delegation signature** - Issuer grants permission to backend wallet (one-time setup)
5. **Backend wallet mints credential** - Executes transaction on Monad with ISSUER_ROLE
6. **Real-time dashboard update** - Envio indexes event and updates all dashboards

**Key Innovation:** Issuers **never pay gas fees** and **never sign minting transactions** - the backend wallet executes on their behalf using MetaMask Delegation.

---

### Credential Verification

![Verifier Dashboard](docs/Images/verifier-dashboard.png)

**Instant verification in 3 steps:**
1. Enter credential token ID
2. Query MongoDB + Envio for dual verification
3. See complete credential details with expandable history

**Results:** Sub-second verification with full audit trail of who verified when.

---

### Holder Experience

![Holder Dashboard](docs/Images/Holder-dashboard.png)

**Holders can:**
- View all their credentials in one dashboard
- Share credentials on Farcaster with verifiable frames
- Access IPFS metadata and blockchain transaction links
- See credential status (Active/Revoked) in real-time

---

## üîó Blockchain Integration

### Monad Testnet Transactions

![Monad Transaction](docs/Images/monad-testnet.png)

All credentials are minted as **Soulbound NFTs** on Monad Testnet:
- **Chain ID:** 10143
- **Performance:** 10,000 TPS, 400ms blocks, 800ms finality
- **Transaction Type:** Legacy (EVM-compatible)
- **Gas Model:** Backend wallet pays, issuer doesn't

---

### IPFS Metadata Storage

![IPFS Metadata](docs/Images/ipfs.png)

Every credential's metadata is stored on **IPFS** for permanent, decentralized access:
- Credential type and details
- Issuance and expiration dates
- Issuer and recipient information
- Cryptographic proof of authenticity

---

## üìä Envio Integration

### Real-Time Event Indexing

![Envio Indexer](docs/Images/envio.png)

Envio HyperIndex powers VeriCred+ with **GraphQL queries** for:
- AI fraud analysis (queries recipient on-chain history)
- Dashboard statistics (real-time credential counts)
- Verification lookups (instant credential status)
- Farcaster Frames (social media verification)

---

### Running Locally

![Envio Running Locally](docs/Images/envio-running-locally.png)

## üéØ Track Qualifications

### ü§ñ Track 1: Best AI Agent

**How we qualify:**

‚úÖ **AI agent leverages delegations** - Our fraud detection AI works with MetaMask delegation to automate credential issuance

‚úÖ **Acts on behalf of users on Monad** - Backend wallet executes minting transactions using delegated permissions

‚úÖ **Deployed on Monad testnet** - All contracts and transactions on Chain ID 10143

‚úÖ **MetaMask Smart Accounts integration shown** - Full delegation flow in demo

‚úÖ **Envio usage demonstrated** - AI queries Envio for on-chain history analysis

**The Innovation:**

Our AI Fraud Analysis Agent:
1. **Queries Envio** for recipient's complete on-chain history
2. **Analyzes with GPT-4o** to detect suspicious patterns
3. **Generates risk scores** (0-100) with actionable recommendations
4. **Triggers delegation** only after AI approval
5. **Autonomous execution** - Backend wallet mints without manual intervention

**Why we win:** Real-world fraud prevention combined with seamless automation. The AI doesn't just analyze‚Äîit actively prevents fraudulent credential issuance while using delegation to execute on behalf of issuers.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Track 2: Best On-Chain Automation

**How we qualify:**

‚úÖ **Ultimate chain automation** - Fully automated credential issuance pipeline
